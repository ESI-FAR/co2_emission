## [0.1.0] (2025-02-04)

With this workflow you can make forecasts of the emission factor (kgCO2eq/kWh)
of the electricity grid of the Netherlands.

The forecast is based on data sourced from the [Nationaal Energie Dashboard](https://ned.nl/).

Included in this repository are both the code to reproduce the model, as well as a 
(containerized) workflow to produce forecasts.

0.1.0 marks the first release of this model, compatibility between this version and
newer versions is not guaranteed.
